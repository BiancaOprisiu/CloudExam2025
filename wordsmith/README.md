# Wordsmith App

Wordsmith is the demo project originally shown at DockerCon EU 2017 and 2018.

The demo app runs across three containers:

- **[api](api/Dockerfile)** - a Java REST API which serves words read from the database
- **[web](web/Dockerfile)** - a Go web application that calls the API and builds words into sentences
- **db** - a Postgres database that stores words
